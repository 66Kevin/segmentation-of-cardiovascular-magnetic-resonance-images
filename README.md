# segmentation-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-images

This repository is about semantic segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images using deep learning. 
In digital image processing and computer vision, semantic image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. 
This process can simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.

The aim is to develop an automated methodology using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is capable of segmenting a CMR image into four regions: the background, the left ventricle (LV), the right ventricle (RV) and the myocardium (Myo).

More details are shown in the PDF report under root file of this reporsitory.
